### My solution
explanation:
- the first part is easy, we find the first indexes from left and right that violates the non decreasing property
- so we have 3 subarrays now (left, right and middle unsorted part)
- the answer could be the removing left + middle or removing right + middle, so we need to initalize our answer to the minimum of these 2 lengths
- the final possibility is that only middle needs to be removed, but it is possible that left and right do not form a non-decreasing sequence after they are merged, because left[-1] could be greater than right[0]
- how to find the minimum number of elements to be sliced off from the end of left subarray and start of right subarray so that they can be concatenated?
- turns out you can do this in linear time using 2 pointers
- initialize ptr1=left[0], ptr2=right[0]
  - keep moving ptr1 until we reach a number > ptr2
  - check img for the rest of the explanation
